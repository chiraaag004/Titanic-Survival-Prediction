# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. It uses the famous Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and follows a complete data science workflow including EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding, missing values, binning)
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
